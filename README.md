# C++ Learning

This repo contains every code I'd write while learning to code in C++. Might also contain Algorithm problems and their solutions in C++.

### What is the `others` folder?

The `others` folder contains code (algorithms) that aren't in C++ (most often, Javascript). This is so I don't have too many folders or repos.
